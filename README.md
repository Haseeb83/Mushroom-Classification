# Mushroom-Classification
As we all know that in our daily life we all use mushrooms. Mushrooms are the eatable fungi that can be found extensively in a variety of natural environments and visual identification of mushroom species is well established. Some mushrooms are known because of their nutritional and therapeutical properties. Some species are known all over the world because of their toxicity that causes fatal accidents every year mainly due to misidentification, Therefore, classification of mushrooms is becoming a major issue. 
In this project, I will examine the dataset of mushrooms which contains 8124 values of mushroom with the different features like cap surface, cap shape, cap color, bruises, and odor, gill-attach, gill size, gill spacing, gill color, stalk shape, stalk root, stalk surface above ring, stalk surface below ring, veil type, veil color and ring type etc.
In this project I will use the following techniques of machine learning algorithm that will detect if the mushroom is edible or poisonous by its features like cap surface, shape, color and bruises etc.
1.	Decision Tree
2.	Logistic Regression
3.	Random Forest
4.	Naive Byes
5.	k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
6.	Support Vector Machine Classifier
I train a model using Python language and Jupyter Notebook that will help us to distinguish between the edible and poisonous fungi and also tell us that which algorithm is best for classification in the future.
